# AntHiveMindLogic

This is a personal project to model the behavior of ants as they scout for food and establish pheromone scent trails that guide other ants in the colony to the food source.

## Overview

* Ants use pheromone trails to communicate with one another. 
* When an ant finds food, it lays down a pheromone trail on its way back to the colony.
* Other ants sense this trail and follow it to the food source.
* Over time, the strongest and shortest paths are reinforced by multiple ants following and reinforcing the same trail.
